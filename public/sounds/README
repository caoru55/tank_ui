# Sound Assets

This project uses a structured naming and directory convention for sound assets,
designed to support future "theme switching" (sound skinning) while keeping the
Next.js codebase simple and maintainable.

## Directory Structure

All sound files are stored under `public/sounds/`, following Next.js conventions
for static assets.

public/
  sounds/
    default/
      success.mp3
      error.mp3


- `default/` is the standard theme.
- Additional themes can be added as new directories (e.g., `retro/`, `ocean/`).

## File Naming Rules

Sound files are named by *role*, not by theme.  
This keeps the application logic stable even when themes change.

- `success.mp3` — QR scan success sound  
- `error.mp3` — QR scan error sound  

All themes must provide files with the same names.

## Sound Specification (default theme)

The default theme sound files follow a unified audio profile:

- Total length: **700ms**
- Tail: **100ms fade-out**
- Volume: **normalized to -1dB**
- Success sound: bright tone (2–4kHz)
- Error sound: short, sharp tone (300–800Hz)

These settings are optimized for rapid QR code scanning and clear distinction
between normal and abnormal transitions.

## Source of Original Sound Materials

The default theme is based on copyright-free sound materials from:

- **効果音ラボ (Sound Effect Lab)**  
  https://soundeffect-lab.info/

Processing applied:
- Length adjustment
- Fade-out
- Normalization
- Minor noise cleanup
